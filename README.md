# A_bit_sticky_footer

In this repo, I collected the styles that need to be applied to have a footer at the bottom of the page without positioning it using ~~` position: sticky`~~
---
- You don't have to set the height of your footer, it can be **dynamic**
- You don't have to display the footer above your content.
- Your footer will be displayed **at the bottom of the page** even if you don't have enough content to fill the page.

### Checklist:

- check html, body, root, and footer element's styling in the App.css file!
